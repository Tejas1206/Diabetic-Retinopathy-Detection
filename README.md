# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the eyes and can lead to blindness if not diagnosed and treated early. The goal is to create an automated system that can assist in the early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. (under progress)
